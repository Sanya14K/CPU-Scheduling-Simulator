# CPU Scheduling Simulator 

## About
The CPU Scheduling Algorithm Simulator is a web-based tool that allows users to interactively visualize various CPU scheduling algorithms. 

## Features
- Visualization of 8 CPU Scheduling Algorithms using Gantt chart
- User friendly interface for inserting algorithm parameters

## Algorithms implemented
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- Longest Job First (LJF)
- Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF)
- Priority CPU Scheduling (Non-preemptive)
- Priority CPU Scheduling (Preemptive)
- Round Robin Scheduling (RRS)
